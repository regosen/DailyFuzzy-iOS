# Daily Fuzzy for iOS

I've made Daily Fuzzy open-source!

Here is the source code for the iOS app, which is available here: https://itunes.apple.com/app/id826034630

## Description

It's a simple gallery app that fetches images, gifs and videos from Reddit's r/aww subreddit, with some additional filtering by title (to weed out non-animal pictures and captions inappropriate for children).

This started out as my first iOS project, and it contains starter code from Stanford's CS193p online class notes from a few years back (as noted in some code comments).

## Features

- save images to your device
- track favorites and past images
- daily notifications
